# Project status

**Human-readable current state.** Keep in sync with [AGENT_HANDOFF.md](../AGENT_HANDOFF.md) → *Current state* when milestones ship.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-28 (**16** `[~]` **`2.16.34.7`** parked on **`feature/16-spatial-routing`**; Route GO follows the queue — C4S pin CLEARED, kiss and blind reverse still open)

## Summary

**DerailValleyModv2** — Yard Master Suite v2. **Epic 3 Display Shell (infra) closed** at **3.3.1**. **Epic 4 infra closed** at **4.3**. **Epic 6 Diagnostic HUD closed** at **6.21**. **Epic 7 Governors closed** at **7.5**. **8.7** / **9.1.x** / **13.1** / **13.2.1–2** / **13.2.4** / **13.6.1** / **13.4** on **`main`**. **Next:** finish the Route GO kiss on **`feature/16-spatial-routing`** (UMM **`2.16.34.7`**). The queue, pin match, and C4S `past=11` CLEARED are cab-good. Still open: the 1 km/h coast notches throttle into a closed knuckle, and a reverse leg with a car already coupled never gets a rear gap. **`2.16.33`** desk queue remains the display half. Gemini TDD Mini Win Steps **1–7** are Tier 1 only (`HtpSawtoothTddStepsTests`) — not a cab drive. Desk IMGUI text overlap is known polish debt. Do **not** close Epic 16. Do **not** delete **`feature/16-spatial-routing`** or **`feature/13.2.5-multi-pickup-desk`**. Full v1 map: [V1_FEATURE_COVERAGE.md](V1_FEATURE_COVERAGE.md). Canonical HTP: [HTP.md](HTP.md). Walk: [13.2.5-WALK.md](13.2.5-WALK.md).

## Sequence

**Next:** Stay on **`feature/16-spatial-routing`**. Leave **16.2** open. The two open cab fails are the 1 km/h coast shove and the null rear gap on a reverse with a car already coupled. Do not cab-walk TDD Steps 1–7. Do not pop `stash@{0}`. Do not merge `main` until CMPH.
